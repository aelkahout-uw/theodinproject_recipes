    <img src="./img_sources/tzatziki.jpg" alt="tzatziki">
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ English cucumber, partially peeled (striped) and sliced.</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt divided.</li>
      <li>4 to 5 garlic cloves, peeled, finely grated or minced (you start with 1 to 2 garlic cloves, if you don't want it to be too strong).</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white vinegar.</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Greek Extra Virgin Olive Oil.</li>
      <li>2 cups plain Greek yogurt.</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground white pepper.</li>
      <li>Warm pita bread for serving.</li>
      <li>Sliced vegetables for serving.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2> Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Use a box grater to manually grate the cucumbers or you can use a small food processor to finely chop the cucumbers as I do in this recipe. Toss the grated cucumbers with ½ teaspoon kosher salt. Spoon the grated cucumber into a cheese cloth or a double thickness napkin and squeeze dry. (There will be a lot of liquid).</li>
    <li>In one large mixing bowl, place the garlic with remaining ½ teaspoon salt, white vinegar, and extra virgin olive oil. Mix to combine.</li>
    <li>Add the grated cucumber to the bowl with the garlic mixture. Stir in the yogurt, and a pinch of white or black pepper, and the fresh herbs (if using. I did not use fresh herbs in the video). Stir to combine well.</li>
    <li>Cover and refrigerate for a bit (anywhere from 30 minutes to a couple hours before serving). This will help thicken the sauce and give it the best texture, while allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
    <li>When ready to serve, stir the tzatziki sauce to refresh and transfer to serving bowl, drizzle with more extra virgin olive oil, if you like. Serve with your favorite veggies, pita chips or wedges (be sure to read the post for more ideas on how to use this sauce)!</li>
